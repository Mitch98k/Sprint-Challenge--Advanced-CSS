// 1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
// An adaptive website is designed to aid those with disabilities such as hearing or vision problems. 
// A fully responsive website is designed to change based on the size of the screen so that all users on all divices can view a neat, clean looking website. 

// 2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
// In mobile first, you design the website with its mobile appearance first, then you make it responsive for desktop.
// In desktop first, you do just the opposite-designing with desktop appearance in mind first, then making it responsive for mobile.
// 3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?
// It simplifies the use of the rem units so that 1 rem is equal to 10 pixels. This makes the math very easy as 0.1 rem is one pixel.
// 4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
// Preprocess is simply the act of writing CSS in a different, more powerful language (such as LESS) instead. 
// A program, known as a compiler, then takes the code you wrote and transfers it to CSS. 
//This way, you never have to bother yourself with regular CSS and can do a lot more things with less work required.
// 5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
// Parametric Mixins are my favorite. There is just so much that you can do with it!
// Honestly, none of the concepts give me much trouble. The only problem is when I don't know the syntax, but that is easily solved by the resources provided in slack.
